# FVM Launch Memorial NFT

This is the very first smart contract deployed on the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM).

It was deployed at tipset [2683360](https://filfox.info/en/tipset/2683360)

[FVM Launched at 2023-03-14 15:14:00 UTC](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/fvm-is-live-on-mainnet/) and was the cumulative work of dozens of people over two years.

To commemorate the successful launch of FVM, a soulbound NFT was minted and bound to the contract address. This is the soul of FVM and this NFT can never be transferred or burned.
